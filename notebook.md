### System allowing easy multi layer abstraction representation of a sequence process (content, rules for generating content, etc.)

---
## Goal

The main goal of this project is to propose an architecture in which it is possible to represent information on a multi-dimensional abstraction manner.

Thoses representations from the content of the entity to the logic understanding of its very existance would allow machines to learn more deeper representation and comprehension about the generation of such entities.

One big question leading to this project comes from the threshold beetween physical learning and cognitive learning. Physical learning can be seen as the evolution of a brain neuronal structure through a species. Coginitive learning is the understanding and comprehension of the world and its functionning using only this neural structure to encode new data. The question is:
 * where is this threshold ?
 * what is the most abstract representation we can understand about something ?
 * is there an actual limit ?
